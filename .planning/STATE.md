# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Iterative feedback loop between neural scoring and social simulation produces measurably better content than single-pass generation
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — orchestrator-integration-pipeline

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from sprint structure; Phases 2/3/4 parallel, Phases 6/7/8 parallel
- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity (9 phases) maps 1:1 with sprint tracks
- [Phase 05]: JSON text columns for TRIBE scores, MiroFish metrics, composite scores (D-08)
- [Phase 05]: CampaignStore uses dependency injection (Database via constructor) for testability
- [Phase 05]: Pydantic model deserialization on read: JSON columns loaded as dicts then unpacked into typed models

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- HuggingFace LLaMA 3.2-3B gated model access approval can take 1-24 hours (blocks Phase 3: TRIBE v2)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit install can be tricky on Windows (affects Phase 1: ENV-01)
- MiroFish is a fork/submodule with minimal modifications to preserve upstream merge capability
