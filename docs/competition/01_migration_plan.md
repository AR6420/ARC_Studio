# AMD Hackathon — Phased Migration Plan

Budget: ~25 GPU-hours on 1× MI300X. Solo. Submission window: May 4-10, 2026.

## Strategy

- **Local prep first** (Phases 0-2). Burn zero cloud hours on work that can be done on the dev box: code refactor, container builds, model downloads-to-cache validation, test suites with mocked vLLM.
- **Cloud-only for ROCm validation and demo** (Phases 3-6). Land on MI300X with image already built and code already passing locally.
- Reserve **~5 hours buffer** for the unknown. Do not exceed budget on validation phases.

## Phase 0 — Local: orchestrator LLM-provider abstraction (0 cloud hrs) — **DONE**

**Goal achieved**: orchestrator routes LLM calls through either Anthropic SDK (default) or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `LLM_PROVIDER` env var. 251 tests pass (235 baseline + 16 new). Production behaviour identical when `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`.

**Decisions vs original plan**:
- **Models bumped** to Qwen3.5 dense (Apr 2026) primary, Qwen3 dense (Apr 2025) documented fallback. See `MODELS.md`. Code is model-name-agnostic — swap is a config change.
- **No edits to `claude_client.py`.** It already conforms to the new `LLMClient` Protocol via duck typing; touching it risks regressing the production path. Protocol is a `typing.Protocol`, not a forced ABC.
- **No `mock_claude_client` fixture changes.** It's a generic `AsyncMock` already provider-agnostic; works with both clients unchanged.
- **B4 read finding**: the legacy `llm_fallback_*` settings in `config.py` are aspirational (zero call sites). Left in place but flagged as superseded by `LLM_PROVIDER`. See `00_audit.md` Appendix A.
- **B1 read finding**: MiroFish concurrency is hard-capped at `semaphore=30` per OASIS env (60 across parallel mode). Phase 5 KV-cache sizing on Qwen3.5-9B is comfortable. See `00_audit.md` Appendix B.

**Files added**:
- `orchestrator/clients/llm_protocol.py`
- `orchestrator/clients/openai_compat_client.py`
- `orchestrator/clients/llm_factory.py`
- `orchestrator/tests/test_openai_compat_client.py` (12 tests)
- `orchestrator/tests/test_vllm_smoke.py` (1 in-process E2E)
- `docs/competition/MODELS.md`, `docs/competition/03_run_locally.md`

**Files modified**:
- `orchestrator/config.py`, `orchestrator/api/__init__.py`, `orchestrator/cli.py`, `orchestrator/clients/__init__.py`, `orchestrator/requirements.txt`
- `orchestrator/tests/test_cli.py`, `orchestrator/tests/test_integration_loop.py` (patch target moved from `ClaudeClient` to `build_llm_client`)
- `tribe_scorer/requirements.txt` (torch pin relaxed `<2.7` → `<3.0`)
- `CLAUDE.md` (drop stale sm_120/CPU-fallback claim, add hackathon section)
- `.env.example` (drop leftover `TRIBE_TEXT_ONLY`)
- `.gitignore` (carve out `docs/competition/`)

**Validation passed**:
- `pytest --ignore=orchestrator/tests/test_tribe_timeout.py` — 251 passed.
- `test_tribe_timeout.py` is pre-existing broken on `main` (imports `CHUNK_SIZE_WORDS` that doesn't exist; commit `495956b`). Out of scope for Phase 0.
- E2E smoke: variant_generator → OpenAICompatClient → in-process FastAPI fake vLLM → parsed variants. Wiring confirmed before MI300X provisioning.

## Phase 1 — Local: TRIBE GPU-path un-pinning + whisperx replacement + ROCm dockerfile (0 cloud hrs) — **DONE**

**Goal achieved**: TRIBE source no longer hard-codes CPU at runtime; whisperx swapped for transformers Whisper-large-v3 (Path B); ROCm Dockerfile + compose overlay written; per-window timeline preserved through the API for Phase 5 UI. 251 orchestrator tests + 32 tribe_scorer tests green.

**Decisions vs original plan**:
- **Path B confirmed** (transformers Whisper). ctranslate2 + faster-whisper out of the dep tree entirely.
- **Vendored TRIBE source NOT edited.** `tribe_scorer/vendor/tribev2/` is tracked as a git **submodule** (separate `.git`, gitignored in parent, gitlink at commit `7fd7b41`). Editing files inside means committing to inner repo + bumping parent pointer — high cost for a one-line monkey-patch. **Cleaner alternative used**: install a startup monkey-patch from `tribe_scorer/scoring/whisper_hf.py:install_eventstransforms_patch()` that replaces `ExtractWordsFromAudio._get_transcript_from_audio` in-process. Vendored source on disk stays Meta-upstream (zero submodule pointer churn). The hard-coded `device="cpu"` and `compute_type="float32"` lines at `vendor/tribev2/tribev2/eventstransforms.py:104-105` become dead code — replaced wholesale at startup before any whisperx import can fire.
- **Per-window timeline added** as a parallel set of functions (`score_text_with_timeline`, `score_audio_with_timeline`, `score_video_with_timeline`) instead of refactoring existing scorers' return signatures. Keeps the 7 chunking tests + baseline-seeding code paths untouched. Single endpoints emit `timeline` + `tr_seconds`; batch endpoint stays scalar-only (consumer-deferred).

**Files added**:
- `tribe_scorer/scoring/whisper_hf.py` — transformers Whisper-large-v3 wrapper + idempotent monkey-patch installer
- `tribe_scorer/Dockerfile.rocm` — `rocm/pytorch:rocm6.2_ubuntu22.04_py3.11_pytorch_2.5.1` base, ffmpeg + Python deps, preserves the preinstalled ROCm torch wheel
- `docker-compose.rocm.yml` — overlay adding the tribe_scorer container with `/dev/kfd` + `/dev/dri` passthrough, video group, host IPC, 16 GB shm
- `tribe_scorer/tests/test_whisper_hf.py` — 8 tests, mocked HF pipeline (no weights downloaded)
- `tribe_scorer/tests/test_timeline_output.py` — 8 tests covering per-window ROI extraction + score_text_with_timeline
- `docs/competition/TRIBE_API.md` — response shape contract for Phase 5

**Files modified**:
- `tribe_scorer/main.py` — wire whisper_hf patch at startup; add `timeline` + `tr_seconds` fields to `ScoreResponse`/`AudioScoreResponse`/`VideoScoreResponse`; switch single endpoints to `_with_timeline` scorer variants
- `tribe_scorer/scoring/text_scorer.py` — `_score_single_chunk` returns 4-tuple (now includes raw `preds`); legacy `score_text` drops the new value; add `score_text_with_timeline`
- `tribe_scorer/scoring/audio_scorer.py` — add `score_audio_with_timeline`
- `tribe_scorer/scoring/video_scorer.py` — add `score_video_with_timeline`
- `tribe_scorer/scoring/roi_extractor.py` — add `extract_roi_activations_per_window`
- `tribe_scorer/requirements.txt` — bump `transformers` to `>=4.45.0` (needed for Whisper-large-v3 word timestamps), add `torchaudio>=2.5.0,<3.0`. whisperx/faster-whisper/ctranslate2 were never in `requirements.txt` (installed ad-hoc via README per the audit), so nothing to remove
- `orchestrator/clients/tribe_client.py:_extract_scores` — passthrough `timeline` + `tr_seconds`
- `CLAUDE.md` — note whisperx removed; transformers Whisper is the new path

**Validation passed**:
- `pytest tribe_scorer/tests` — 32 passed
- `pytest --ignore=orchestrator/tests/test_tribe_timeout.py` — 251 passed (orchestrator suite, regression-free)

**Validation deferred**:
- `docker build -f tribe_scorer/Dockerfile.rocm tribe_scorer/` — Docker daemon was not running on the local box during this session. Image build will be re-validated either (a) in a follow-up session with Docker Desktop running, or (b) on first cloud provisioning in Phase 3 (the Dockerfile is intentionally minimal so first-build iteration is cheap).

**Risk update**:
- `ctranslate2` risk gone (eliminated by Path B).
- `neuralset` / `neuraltrain` ROCm risk unchanged (still unknown until Phase 3).
- New transformers-Whisper alignment-quality risk: ~50-100ms vs whisperx ~20-50ms — well within TRIBE's window-level scoring tolerance. Documented in `whisper_hf.py` docstring.

## Phase 2 — Local: vLLM container + model download dry-run (0 cloud hrs)

**Goal**: docker-compose includes a vLLM service stub and model weights are pre-cached on dev box (will rsync to cloud later, or HF-pull on cloud).

**Files touched**:
- `docker-compose.rocm.yml` — add `vllm-orchestrator` and `vllm-agents` services using `rocm/vllm:latest` image (or AMD's vLLM Quick Start image)
- `.env.hackathon` — Qwen model names, HF token, base URL
- `scripts/prefetch_models.sh` — `huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` + 32B

**Validation**:
- Compose file parses, image pulls, weights cached locally
- Run vLLM **CPU build** locally (slow, but proves config) for one prompt — OR use `vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server` mocked test

**Risk**: low. No GPU code yet.

## Phase 3 — Cloud: smoke test on MI300X (~3 cloud hrs)

**Goal**: 1 stimulus → real ROCm-TRIBE → 100 MiroFish agents on Qwen 7B vLLM → Qwen 32B orchestrator → output JSON.

**Steps**:
1. Provision MI300X instance from AMD Quick Start vLLM image
2. Clone repo on `competition/amd-hackathon`, copy `.env.hackathon`
3. Pull MiroFish submodule, build TRIBE ROCm image, spin up compose stack
4. `huggingface-cli download` both Qwen models (Qwen 7B ~15GB, Qwen 32B ~65GB — over network, ~10 min)
5. Start vLLM-orchestrator (32B) and vLLM-agents (7B) on the same GPU with `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.45` each (or sequential vLLM if they collide)
6. Run CLI: `python -m orchestrator.cli --seed-content "..." --max-iterations 1` with **N=100 agents**

**Validation criteria**:
- All 7 TRIBE neural dimensions return real (non-pseudo) values
- TRIBE peak VRAM logged > 0
- 100 MiroFish agents complete
- Composite scorer produces non-None values
- Opus-equivalent (Qwen 32B) produces structured JSON analysis

**Cloud-hour budget**: 3 hrs. If still failing at hour 3, **stop and reassess**. Likely culprits: ctranslate2/whisperx, two vLLMs on one GPU, neuralset compatibility.

**Risk**: **HIGH** — first time anything in this stack runs on AMD silicon. Two genuine unknowns: (1) `neuralset`/`neuraltrain` ROCm behavior, (2) two-vLLM-on-one-GPU memory partition. Fallback if (2) blocks: serve only Qwen 7B from vLLM, keep "orchestrator" tier on Qwen 7B as well for the smoke phase. Demote 32B to Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — Cloud: real campaign at full quality (~6 cloud hrs)

**Goal**: 4-iteration campaign with 40 agents, both Qwen tiers active, completing under 20 min (CLAUDE.md target).

**Files touched**: tuning only — vLLM `--max-num-seqs`, `--max-model-len`, `gpu_memory_utilization`. No source changes if Phase 3 passed.

**Validation**:
- End-to-end campaign matches `<= 20 min` constraint from CLAUDE.md
- All 7 composite scoring formulas produce values within plausible ranges
- Cross-system Opus analysis produces non-trivial output

**Cloud-hour budget**: 6 hrs (mostly tuning + repeat runs).

**Risk**: medium. KV-cache OOM is the most likely hiccup; mitigation is `--max-num-seqs` reduction.

## Phase 5 — Cloud: 1000-agent demo path + viz wiring (~6 cloud hrs)

**Goal**: 1000-agent simulation with live visualization matching MiroFish project-website demo.

**Files touched**:
- `mirofish/frontend/` — already has Vue UI with polling-based "realtime" endpoints (`profiles/realtime`, `config/realtime`, `run-status`). Confirm it stands up and is reachable from outside the cloud VM.
- `docker-compose.rocm.yml` — expose MiroFish frontend port externally
- Possibly `ui/` (orchestrator React UI) — embed MiroFish UI via iframe, or accept that the demo opens MiroFish's own UI directly
- Throughput tuning: MiroFish agent batching (`mirofish/backend/scripts/run_parallel_simulation.py`) to keep Qwen 7B vLLM saturated without OOM

**Validation**:
- 1000 agents run to completion
- Vue UI shows live graph updates
- Demo recordable as a single screen-share

**Cloud-hour budget**: 6 hrs.

**Risk**: **MEDIUM-HIGH** — 1000-agent concurrency is untested in this repo. KV-cache pressure is real. Fallback: scale demo to 500 agents if 1000 OOMs the agent vLLM, document in submission.

## Phase 6 — Cloud: submission polish (~3 cloud hrs)

**Goal**: clean demo recording, README updates, hackathon submission artifacts.

**Files touched**: `README.md`, `docs/competition/`, possibly `mirofish/` README crosslink.

**Validation**:
- Demo video recorded (ideally 2 min, < 5 min)
- Repro instructions in `docs/competition/03_run_on_amd.md` (to be added during this phase)
- Submission form filled

**Cloud-hour budget**: 3 hrs.

## Phase risk matrix

| Phase | Risk | Top blocker | Fallback |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| 0 | LOW | refactor regression | revert; existing tests catch it |
| 1 | MEDIUM | `ctranslate2` ROCm | replace whisperx with `transformers` Whisper |
| 2 | LOW | image pull bandwidth | none needed |
| 3 | HIGH | `neuralset` ROCm; 2-vLLM colocation | sequential model loading; pseudo-score path stays as escape valve |
| 4 | MED | KV-cache OOM | reduce `--max-num-seqs` |
| 5 | MED-HIGH | 1000-agent concurrency | scale demo to 500 |
| 6 | LOW | — | — |
